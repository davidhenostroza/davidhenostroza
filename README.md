### Hi there üëãüê∫
I am David, you can call me Deyvid. I am a psychologist and I am passionate about these topics: Social Engineering, International Relations, social economic development, and Data Science. I entered the world of programming at the age of 15 due to my addiction to video games. I was a huge fan of Warcraft and Dota, spending hours and hours playing. At one point, I became interested in integrating some cartoon characters I saw into Warcraft maps. With that motivation and curiosity, I stumbled upon the Warcraft editor. I spent countless hours learning on forums and empirically exploring its use to the extent that I grasped the essence of programming languages: variables, variable types, events, sequences, conditions, iterators, triggers, errors, among others. That initial motivation to integrate my interests led me to learn 3D graphics formatting in order to include my characters. It was during those hours (more than 10 hours a day) for days, months, and approximately 3 years that I began my journey into programming.

Currently, I am learning Cloud Computing. I started with AWS and programming languages like C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Next, I will move on to learn Azure and further develop my skills in Python and R. Concurrently, I am studying political economy, a subject that also fascinates me. As soon as I finish this readme, I'll continue with other courses. Next year, I'll be starting my master's in Psychology: Behavioral Data Scientist. I'm seeking to collaborate on projects related to Human Resources, Consumer Behavior, and Social Analysis.

Ask me about psychoanalytic theories, International Relations theories, Economic Psychology, and Data Analysis.

Hobbies: Sports, Music, and Literature.
Fun fact: My boss calls me 'ghost'! :D
